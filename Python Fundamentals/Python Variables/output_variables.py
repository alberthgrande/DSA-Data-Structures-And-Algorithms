"""
Output Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
"""
# x = "Python is awesome"
# print(x)

"""
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
"""
# x = "Python"
# y = "is"
# z = "awesome"
# print(x, y, z)

"""
You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
"""
# x = "Python "
# y = "is "
# z = "awesome"
# print(x + y + z)

"""
For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
"""
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

"""
The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
"""
x = 5
y = "y"
print(x, y)
