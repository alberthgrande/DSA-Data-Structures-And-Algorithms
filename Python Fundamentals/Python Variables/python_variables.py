# Single or Double Quotes?

# Variable Names
"""
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# myvar = "myvar"
# my_var = "my_var"
# _my_var = "_my_var"
# myVar = "myVar"
# MYVAR = "MYVAR"
# myvar2 = "myvar2"
# print(myvar)
# print(my_var)
# print(_my_var)
# print(myVar)

# Multi Words Variable Names
# Camel Case - Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
# myVariableName = "myVariableName"
# print(myVariableName)

# Pascal Case - Each word starts with a capital letter:
# MyVariableName = "MyVariableName"
# print(MyVariableName)

# Snake Case - Each word is separated by an underscore character:
# my_variable_name = "my_variable_name"
# print(my_variable_name)
