# Slicing
# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
# Note: The first character has index 0.
b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[2:5]) 

# Slice From the Start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[:5]) 

# Slice To the End
# By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[2:])

# Negative Indexing
# Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
"""
Example
Get the characters:

From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):
