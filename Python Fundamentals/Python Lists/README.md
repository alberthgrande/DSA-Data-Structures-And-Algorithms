# Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable\*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered\*\* and changeable. No duplicate members.

        \*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
